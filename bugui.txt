https://syawalqi.github.io/MePetCarePy/#/owners/4 for example is the ui is crap and not good

https://syawalqi.github.io/MePetCarePy/#/patients/1/records/new then here is just a blank page with nothing on it

make a delete owner button on the owner detail page accessible for admin and vet only, remeber when deleting always use soft delete

then make a session on each user logged in, the same user cannot login again even by using different browser or device, and if the user is logged out, the session will be deleted, and if the user is inactive for 1 hour, the session will be deleted

read through the root folder and put all the files in the correct folder, and make sure the project is well-organized


delete this files after all is implemented
