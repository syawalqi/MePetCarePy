# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
*   **Aesthetic:** Clean, clinical, and professional. The design prioritizes readability, data density, and a clutter-free interface to support efficient clinical workflows.
*   **Design System:** Material Design principles may be used as a reference to ensure consistency, accessibility, and familiarity. The system is not strictly bound to any specific UI framework or component library.
*   **Accessibility:** High contrast and accessibility-first principles will be strictly followed to ensure usability for all staff members, regardless of visual ability or lighting conditions.

## User Experience (UX) Goals
*   **Efficiency:** Workflows should be streamlined to minimize clicks and data entry time for busy clinic staff.
*   **Clarity:** Information hierarchy should be clear, highlighting critical patient status and medical alerts.
*   **Reliability:** Feedback on actions (saves, deletes, errors) must be immediate and unambiguous.

## Tone of Voice
*   Professional, direct, and reassuring. System messages should be concise and helpful.
